## 🔧 Add Screenshots to README

### Main Dashboard Screenshot (Already Done!)

I've already updated your README to use:
```markdown
![TaskBoard Demo](docs/screenshots/dashboard.png)
```

Just save your screenshot to: `docs/screenshots/dashboard.png`

### Add Additional Screenshots (Optional)

You can add more screenshots anywhere in your README. Here are some suggestions:

## 🎨 Screenshot Tips for Maximum Impact

### ✅ Do's:
- ✅ Use **full HD resolution** (1920x1080 or higher)
- ✅ Show the app with **sample data** (boards, tasks)
- ✅ Capture the **beautiful gradient UI**
- ✅ Show **real-time connection** indicator (green dot)
- ✅ Use **browser without extensions** (clean look)
- ✅ Show the app in **light mode** (better for images)
- ✅ Crop to show **only the application** (no desktop background)

### ❌ Don'ts:
- ❌ Don't show personal information
- ❌ Don't use low resolution
- ❌ Don't include browser bookmarks bar
- ❌ Don't show error messages
